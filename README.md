* Alessandro Pegurri (Chemical Engineering)
* Bruno Ursino (Mathematical Engineering)
* Chiara Vitale (Chemical Engineering)

## Assignment 1
* Implement a simulator of the conservative double pendulum using the Velocity-Verlet method as symplecting integrator and study the accuracy of trajectories and total energy with respect to time step.
* Reformulate the model so that the contraints are accounted for, simulating in cartesian coordinates using the SHAKE method.
* Apply the Velocity-Verlet method to the Frozen Argon Crystal example as in *Hairer, Lubich, Wanner - Geometric Numerical Integration - Section I.4*.

## Assignment 2
Reproduce the example in *Gabriel, Knapek, Zumbusch - Numerical Simulation in Molecular Dynamics - Section 3.6.1* using periodic boundary conditions.

## Assignment 3
Reproduce the example of Rayleigh-Taylor instability with Coulomb potential in *Gabriel, Knapek, Zumbusch - Numerical Simulation in Molecular Dynamics - Section 7.4.1*.
